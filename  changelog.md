Content update:\
I added my personal background information below 'my strength and weaknesses'.\
I also added a button 'my skills' that will popup a form that displays my programming language skills.\
\
CSS update:\
I added background-color transition for the introduction paragraph, extra-information section, and the newly added personal background information part.\
The new "my skills" button will rotate 360 degrees after hover.\
\
JS updates:\
When the introduction sections is clicked (above extra information), the background color will change, and if clicked again, it will switch to its original color.\
When we click 'my skills' button a popup window will show up along with 'close' button.
